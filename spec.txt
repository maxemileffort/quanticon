## App Summary  
**App Name (Working Title):** Quanticon  
**One-liner Description:** Monte Carlo your way to smarter trades by simulating randomized strategies over technical indicators  
**What does the app do?**  
Quanticon allows users to simulate and analyze trading strategies using Monte Carlo techniques. Users select a financial instrument, timeframe, and number of technical indicators, and the app builds randomized feature sets and model parameters to generate and evaluate potential trading strategies.

---

## User Roles & Permissions  
**Primary User Roles:**  
- **Guest**  
  - Can access the landing page, limited simulations (e.g., 1/day), and view sample output with ads  
- **Logged-in User**  
  - Can run unlimited simulations, save results, and compare strategies  
- **Admin**  
  - Manage users, monitor resource usage, update indicator libraries, and perform DB admin tasks  

---

## Core Features (MVP)  
- Users can sign up and log in with email/password  
- Users select a symbol (e.g., SPX), timeframe, and number of indicators  
- The system randomly selects technical indicators and their parameters  
- Users define target ROI per trade  
- The app generates target labels (entries/exits) based on ROI  
- Monte Carlo simulations are run across randomized feature/parameter space  
- Resulting equity curves and performance stats are shown  
- Users can rerun simulations with new randomness  
- Admin dashboard to monitor compute cost, user activity, and manage DB entries  

---

## Pages / Routes  
- `/` â€“ Landing page with product description, CTA, and login/signup links  
- `/dashboard` â€“ User dashboard with saved simulations and new simulation form  
- `/simulate` â€“ Interactive form to set simulation parameters and view results  
- `/results/[id]` â€“ Detail view of a simulation run with charts and performance metrics  
- `/admin` â€“ Admin panel for managing users and system settings  
- `/admin/db` â€“ Utility interface for Postgres DB management (admin-only)

## Design & Layout  
- **Preferred Style:** Minimalist, fintech-grade, dark mode-first  
- **Color Scheme & Fonts:** Navy, dark gray, green for profits; use a monospaced font for output sections  
- **Example Sites You Like:**  
  - [https://quantconnect.com](https://www.quantconnect.com) â€“ sleek, data-focused layout  
  - [https://tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com) â€“ intuitive UX for traders  

---

## Deployment Preferences  
- **Frontend Hosting:** Netlify  
- **Backend Hosting:** Heroku  
- **Database Type:** PostgreSQL on Heroku  
- **Frontend Framework Preference:** Next.js (React-based)  
- **Backend Framework:** Node.js / Express or FastAPI  
- **Job Queue / Background Task System:** BullMQ (Node) or Celery (Python)  

---

## Stretch Features (Nice to Have)  
- Social login (Google, GitHub)  
- Strategy comparison and export to CSV  
- OpenAI-based summary of strategy characteristics  
- Replay of trade logs with annotation  
- Leaderboard of top Monte Carlo results by Sharpe Ratio  

---

## Known Constraints or Requirements  
- Must be mobile-accessible but not fully mobile-first  
- Requires heavy async/queue management for simulations  
- Must allow rapid iteration of technical indicator sets  
- Needs to store high-dimensional time series data  
- Simulations should be containerized for scalability  
- Must support future asset types (e.g., crypto, ETFs)  
- Requires web-based admin tools for Postgres since Heroku lacks a native DB UI
